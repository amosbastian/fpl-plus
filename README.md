## FPL Plus
Browser extension (Chrome) which improves the functionality of https://fantasy.premierleague.com/.

### Install on Chrome

FPL Plus is currently not available on the Chrome store, so you must install it locally and then unpack the extension manually.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run build` to watch code changes and build the unpacked extension
5. Navigate to chrome://extensions/, activate developer mode, click "load unpacked" and select the `build/` folder

### Changelog
